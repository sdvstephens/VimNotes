## LaTeX Template for My Academic Lecture Notes

It is a modified version of the beautiful lecture notes of my late friend, [Gilles Castel](https://github.com/gillescastel/lecture-notes). Different features and macros are taken from several sources according to my preference and necessity. For example, I am using the lecture/chapter title and ToC style from [Ian Lim](https://github.com/qmch/partiii-lecture-notes-201819/)'s lecture notes that I luckily found from [Academia StackExchange](https://academia.stackexchange.com/a/148275/122038).

My template can be viewed directly on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/read/bgvqdrbvnbnq) too.
