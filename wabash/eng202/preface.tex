     These lecture notes were taken in the course \textit{\courseloc} taught by \profloc{} at \instituteloc{} as part of the \classloc{} program (\sessionloc). \bigskip
     
     Currently, these are just drafts of the lecture notes. There can be typos and mistakes anywhere. So, if you find anything that needs to be corrected or improved, please inform at \myemailloc. \bigskip

     I am deeply grateful to my late friend, Gilles Castel, who introduced me to \LaTeX{} for the first time.
